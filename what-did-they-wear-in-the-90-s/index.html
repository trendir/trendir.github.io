If you're unsure about what to wear to a 90's-themed party or just want to learn more about the fashion of the decade, keep reading.</p><p>So, what did they wear in the 90's? One of the most iconic fashion movements of the decade was grunge. This style was characterized by ripped jeans, oversized flannel shirts, and combat boots. Another big trend was hip hop fashion, which included baggy pants, athletic wear, and chunky sneakers. Preppy fashion was also popular, with polo shirts, khakis, and loafers making a comeback.

This look was inspired by the punk movement of the 80's and was characterized by a rough, unkempt appearance. To achieve the ultimate grungy look, start with a pair of ripped jeans or overalls. Layer an oversized flannel shirt on top, and add a vintage band t-shirt underneath. Finish the look with a pair of combat boots, and you're good to go!</p><h2>Hip Hop Fashion: Baggy is Better</h2><p>If you were into hip hop in the 90's, chances are you rocked the baggy pants and oversized shirts look. To recreate this iconic style, start with a pair of loose-fitting pants, like joggers or cargo pants. Pair them with a baggy t-shirt or hoodie, and add a pair of chunky sneakers to complete the look.

To create a preppy outfit, start with a collared shirt or sweater in a neutral color, like navy or beige. Add a pair of khakis or chinos, and finish the look with a pair of loafers or boat shoes. This look is perfect for a day at the office or a casual weekend brunch.</p><h4>How to Accessorize in the 90's</h4><p>No 90's outfit was complete without the right accessories. Chokers were a popular trend, as were statement earrings and layered necklaces. Baseball caps and bucket hats were also a staple of 90's fashion, as were backpacks and fanny packs. Don't be afraid to mix and match different accessories to create a unique look that's all your own.</p><h2>The Iconic Slip Dress</h2><p>The slip dress was one of the most iconic fashion trends of the 90's. This simple, yet elegant dress was made famous by celebrities like Kate Moss and Courtney Love. To recreate this look, start with a simple silk or satin slip dress in a neutral color, like black or white. Layer it over a t-shirt for a more casual look, or wear it on its own for a night out on the town.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q:</strong> What were some popular shoe styles in the 90's?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Some popular shoe styles in the 90's included chunky sneakers, combat boots, platform sandals, and Birkenstocks.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Were crop tops really that popular in the 90's?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, crop tops were a staple of 90's fashion, and were often paired with high-waisted jeans or skirts.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What were some popular hairstyles in the 90's?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Some popular hairstyles in the 90's included the Rachel cut (as made famous by Jennifer Aniston in Friends), crimped hair, and the high ponytail.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What were some popular denim trends in the 90's?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Acid wash jeans, high-waisted jeans, and denim jackets were all popular denim trends in the 90's.</p><h2>Conclusion of What Did They Wear in the 90's</h2><p>The fashion of the 90's was all about individuality and self-expression.
